        <h1 id="terms_of_service">Howl's Eve Terms of Service</h1>
        <h2>Terms of Agreement:</h2>
        <p>By purchasing a ticket for the event "Howl's Eve", you agree to the following terms and conditions. These
            conditions are legally binding and failure to abide by them could result in revocation of access to this
            event and any further events hosted by Tampa Furry Club, henceforth referred to as "the Hosts".</p>
        <p>Assumption of Risk and Liability: Howl's Eve is a live event that will likely include varying levels of
            physical activity, flashing lights, loud music, and sounds, which may pose a risk to certain individuals. By
            purchasing a ticket for Howl's Eve, you acknowledge and accept these risks, and agree to waive any claims
            against, and hold harmless, the Hosts for any injuries or losses, except in cases of gross negligence or
            intentional misconduct by the Host. The Host assumes no responsibility for any lost, damaged, or stolen
            property.</p>
        <h2>Code of Conduct:</h2>
        <p>All ticket holders for Howl's Eve are expected to behave with a reasonable level of appropriateness.
            Disorderly conduct, threatening or aggressive behavior, hazing, stalking, harassment, and similar actions
            will not be tolerated. While alcoholic beverages will be served at the event, it is your responsibility to
            know your limits and maintain appropriate behavior throughout the event.</p>
        <p>All attire, costumes, and similar clothing must not be inappropriate or overly revealing. Shirts, shorts, and
            shoes are the minimum requirements. Any form of fetish-wear is strictly prohibited. Collars may be worn as
            part of normal attire or costume additions, but leashes are prohibited. All attire will be inspected for
            compliance upon entry. Anyone not in compliance will be refused entry until their attire meets the standards
            set by the Hosts.</p>
        <p>Props, accessories, and similar items are allowed, provided they cannot be easily used to cause harm, whether
            intentional or unintentional, and follow the dress code guidelines. Items resembling realistic weapons are
            strictly
            prohibited. All props and accessories will be inspected upon entry. Props that do not comply with the
            guidelines will be held by the Hosts unless deemed extremely dangerous, in which case they will not be
            allowed into the venue.
        </p>
        <p>The Hosts have the authority to remove any person from the premises and revoke their ticket for failure to
            adhere to these conditions.</p>
        <h2>Media Release:</h2>
        <p>By purchasing a ticket, you grant permission for the Hosts to use photographs and/or videos taken of them for
            promotional purposes. If you would prefer to not allow yourself or your likeness to be used in this way,
            please email tampafurryclub@gmail.com with the subject "Request to Rescind Media Release" before the date of
            the event.</p>
        <h2>Merchandise and Refunds:</h2>
        <p>Merchandise will be sold by the Host. Any merchandise purchased can be refunded
            within seven (7) days from the date of the event, provided the items have not been worn, washed, damaged, or
            altered in any way. Tickets purchased before the event, or "Presale Tickets," are refundable until seven (7)
            days before the event. This applies to both standard tickets and "Sponsor Level" tickets. Tickets purchased
            at the event, or "At The Door" tickets, are not refundable. If a "Sponsor Level" ticket is refunded, any
            associated rewards will be forfeited.</p>
        <p>To request a refund, please email tampafurryclub@gmail.com with the subject line "Howl's Eve Refund Request"
            within the refund period.
